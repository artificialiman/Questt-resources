JAMB ENGLISH - EXCEPTIONAL QUESTIONS (1-35)

1. Choose the word that is OPPOSITE in meaning to "ubiquitous"
A. Rare
B. Common
C. Frequent
D. Universal
Answer: A
Explanation: Ubiquitous means present everywhere. Opposite = rare. Exception: Many assume "ubiquitous" means "ancient" due to the Latin root; it actually refers to omnipresence, not age.

2. Choose the option with the same vowel sound as the underlined letters in "blood"
A. Flood
B. Food
C. Mood
D. Good
Answer: A
Explanation: "Blood" /blʌd/ rhymes with "flood" /flʌd/, both have /ʌ/ sound. Exception: Despite identical spelling "oo," words like "food" /fuːd/ have different pronunciation—English spelling is not phonetic.

3. In the sentence "The committee has submitted its report," the verb "has" agrees with:
A. Committee (singular collective noun)
B. Members (implied plural)
C. Report (object)
D. Either A or B
Answer: A
Explanation: Collective nouns take singular verbs when acting as a unit. Exception: British English often uses plural verbs for collectives ("the committee have"), while American English prefers singular.

4. Identify the literary device: "The classroom was a zoo"
A. Simile
B. Metaphor
C. Personification
D. Hyperbole
Answer: B
Explanation: Direct comparison without "like/as" = metaphor. Exception: "The classroom was like a zoo" would be a simile; the absence of "like/as" makes it metaphor.

5. Which sentence uses "lie" correctly?
A. I will lay down for a nap
B. The book is laying on the table
C. Yesterday, I lay down to rest
D. The hen has laid five eggs
Answer: C
Explanation: "Lie" (recline) is intransitive: lie/lay/lain. "Lay" (put down) is transitive: lay/laid/laid. Exception: "Lay" serves as BOTH present tense of "to lay" AND past tense of "to lie"—major confusion point.

6. Choose the correctly punctuated sentence:
A. The teacher said, "homework is due tomorrow".
B. The teacher said, "Homework is due tomorrow."
C. The teacher said "Homework is due tomorrow."
D. The teacher said: "homework is due tomorrow."
Answer: B
Explanation: Comma before quote, capital letter starts quote, period inside closing quote. Exception: In British English, period goes outside quote marks when not part of quoted material.

7. Identify the error: "Neither the students nor the teacher were present"
A. Subject-verb disagreement
B. Pronoun error
C. Tense error
D. No error
Answer: A
Explanation: With "neither...nor," verb agrees with NEAREST subject. "Teacher" (singular) requires "was," not "were." Exception: If order reversed ("Neither teacher nor students were"), "were" would be correct.

8. The prefix "bi-" in "biannual" means:
A. Once every two years
B. Twice a year
C. Half a year
D. Two years long
Answer: B
Explanation: Biannual = twice yearly. Exception: "Biennial" = every two years. These are commonly confused; context often determines meaning.

9. Choose the word with correct spelling:
A. Occured
B. Occurred
C. Ocurred
D. Occureed
Answer: B
Explanation: Double the final consonant before -ed when: (1) one syllable/stressed final syllable, (2) ends in consonant-vowel-consonant. "Occur" fits: oc-CUR. Exception: "Benefit" → "benefited" (stress on first syllable, so no doubling).

10. In "The faster you run, the sooner you'll arrive," the structure is:
A. Comparative correlation
B. Conditional clause
C. Superlative comparison
D. Parallel structure
Answer: A
Explanation: "The + comparative...the + comparative" shows correlation. Exception: Not a true conditional (if/then); describes proportional relationship.

11. Identify the sentence with correct pronoun usage:
A. Between you and I, he's wrong
B. He gave the gift to my wife and I
C. The secret is between you and me
D. Myself and John will attend
Answer: C
Explanation: After prepositions, use objective case (me/him/her). Exception: "Between you and I" is hypercorrection—people overcorrect thinking "I" always sounds formal.

12. The word "sanction" can mean:
A. To approve OR to penalize
B. Only to approve
C. Only to penalize
D. To ignore
Answer: A
Explanation: "Sanction" is an auto-antonym (contronym)—means both approve AND punish. Exception: Context determines meaning; "The UN imposed sanctions" (penalty) vs "The board sanctioned the proposal" (approval).

13. Which uses the subjunctive mood correctly?
A. If I was rich, I'd travel
B. I wish I was taller
C. If he were here, he'd help
D. She acts like she was the boss
Answer: C
Explanation: Subjunctive uses "were" for all persons in contrary-to-fact conditions. Exception: Subjunctive is dying in casual English; "If I was" is increasingly accepted, though "were" remains formally correct.

14. Identify the dangling modifier: 
A. Walking home, the rain started
B. While walking home, I felt raindrops
C. The rain started as I walked home
D. I walked home in the rain
Answer: A
Explanation: "Walking home" illogically modifies "rain" (rain can't walk). Exception: Acceptable in casual speech but technically incorrect; modifier must logically describe the subject.

15. The word "egregious" originally meant "remarkably good" but now means "remarkably bad." This is an example of:
A. Amelioration
B. Pejoration
C. Generalization
D. Specialization
Answer: B
Explanation: Pejoration = word becomes more negative over time. Exception: Opposite process (amelioration) is rarer; "nice" evolved from "foolish" to "pleasant."

16. In "She is taller than I," the implied ending is:
A. Than I am
B. Than me
C. Than I be
D. Either A or B
Answer: A
Explanation: After "than" in formal writing, use subject case when verb is implied: "than I [am tall]." Exception: "Than me" is standard in casual speech and increasingly accepted; both defensible depending on whether you view "than" as conjunction or preposition.

17. Choose the sentence with correct parallel structure:
A. She likes reading, to write, and painting
B. She likes to read, writing, and to paint
C. She likes reading, writing, and painting
D. She likes to read, to write, and painting
Answer: C
Explanation: Parallel elements must have same grammatical form (all gerunds or all infinitives). Exception: Mixed forms are grammatical but stylistically weak.

18. The phrase "I could care less" is:
A. Correct and means indifference
B. Incorrect; should be "couldn't care less"
C. Regional variation, both acceptable
D. Means extreme caring
Answer: B
Explanation: Logically, "couldn't care less" means zero care possible. "Could care less" implies you DO care somewhat. Exception: "Could care less" is now so common it's entering standard usage despite illogic (sarcastic/ironic origin).

19. Identify the oxymoron:
A. Deafening silence
B. Very unique
C. Hot coffee
D. Fast car
Answer: A
Explanation: Oxymoron combines contradictory terms. Silence can't be loud. Exception: "Very unique" is technically wrong (unique is absolute—can't be modified), but not an oxymoron; it's a redundancy.

20. In passive voice, the sentence "The cat chased the mouse" becomes:
A. The mouse was chased by the cat
B. The mouse is chased by the cat
C. The cat was chasing the mouse
D. The mouse has been chased
Answer: A
Explanation: Passive: object becomes subject, verb → be + past participle, original subject in "by" phrase. Exception: "By the cat" can be omitted if agent is unknown/unimportant.

21. The word "literally" is increasingly used to mean:
A. Figuratively (opposite of original meaning)
B. Only in literal sense
C. Approximately
D. Exactly
Answer: A
Explanation: "Literally" now often intensifies figurative statements ("I literally died laughing"). Exception: Purists reject this, but major dictionaries now include figurative usage due to widespread adoption.

22. Choose the sentence with correct comma usage:
A. The red, old, car broke down
B. The old red car broke down
C. The old, red car broke down
D. The, old, red, car broke down
Answer: C
Explanation: Coordinate adjectives (interchangeable order) need commas. "Old" (opinion) and "red" (color) are coordinate. Exception: "Red old car" sounds wrong, suggesting they're NOT coordinate, but standard order is opinion-before-color.

23. The error in "Irregardless of the cost, we'll proceed" is:
A. "Irregardless" is non-standard
B. Comma splice
C. Wrong preposition
D. No error
Answer: A
Explanation: "Irregardless" is double negative (ir- + -less). Standard form: "regardless." Exception: Despite being in dictionaries labeled "nonstandard," it persists in speech and increasingly in writing.

24. In "The data is conclusive," the subject-verb agreement is:
A. Correct (modern usage)
B. Incorrect; should be "data are"
C. Regional variation
D. Either acceptable
Answer: D
Explanation: "Data" is Latin plural of "datum," traditionally taking "are." Modern usage treats it as singular mass noun. Exception: In scientific writing, "data are" still preferred; general writing accepts "data is."

25. Identify the malapropism: "Texas has a large Portuguese population"
A. Portuguese (should be "populace")
B. Large (wrong word)
C. Texas (wrong place)
D. No error
Answer: A
Explanation: Malapropism substitutes similar-sounding wrong word. "Portuguese" (nationality) vs "populace" (population). Exception: Could also be "populous" (adjective); both are malapropisms here.

26. The sentence "Whom did you see?" is:
A. Formally correct
B. Archaic and incorrect
C. Missing auxiliary verb
D. Conversationally wrong
Answer: A
Explanation: "Whom" is object case (direct object of "see"). Exception: In modern English, "who" is replacing "whom" even in object position; "Who did you see?" is now standard in speech.

27. Choose the correct verb form: "If I _____ known, I would have come"
A. have
B. had
C. would have
D. has
Answer: B
Explanation: Past perfect in "if" clause pairs with "would have" in main clause (third conditional). Exception: "If I would have known" is increasingly common but technically incorrect (double modal).

28. The phrase "beg the question" traditionally means:
A. To raise a question
B. To avoid answering
C. To assume what you're trying to prove (circular reasoning)
D. To ask formally
Answer: C
Explanation: "Beg the question" is logical fallacy (petitio principii). Exception: Modern usage = "raises the question," which purists reject but is now dominant meaning.

29. In "She is one of those teachers who inspire students," the verb "inspire" is:
A. Correct (agrees with "teachers")
B. Incorrect; should be "inspires"
C. Either acceptable
D. Subjunctive mood
Answer: A
Explanation: "Who" refers to "teachers" (plural antecedent), so "inspire" (plural verb). Exception: Common error is "inspires" (thinking "one" is antecedent), but "who" modifies "teachers."

30. Identify the split infinitive: 
A. To boldly go where no one has gone
B. To go boldly where no one has gone
C. Boldly to go where no one has gone
D. Both B and C
Answer: A
Explanation: Adverb between "to" and verb = split infinitive. Exception: Split infinitives are now widely accepted when natural; avoiding them can create awkwardness ("to go boldly" vs "to boldly go").

31. The word "presently" means:
A. Currently OR soon
B. Only currently
C. Only soon
D. In the past
Answer: A
Explanation: "Presently" means "soon" (traditional) OR "now" (American usage). Exception: Meaning varies by region; British = soon, American = now. Context required.

32. Choose the correct form: "Neither of the answers _____ correct"
A. is
B. are
C. were
D. be
Answer: A
Explanation: "Neither" is singular pronoun, takes singular verb. Exception: "None" can be singular OR plural depending on context ("none of the water is" vs "none of the students are").

33. In "The house was engulfed in flames," the phrase "in flames" functions as:
A. Adverbial phrase
B. Adjectival phrase
C. Noun phrase
D. Prepositional object
Answer: A
Explanation: "In flames" describes how/in what state house was engulfed (modifies verb). Exception: Could argue adjectival (describing house's state), but primary function is adverbial.

34. The sentence "We was ready to leave" contains:
A. Dialect grammar (nonstandard but systematic)
B. Random error
C. Code-switching
D. Correct grammar
Answer: A
Explanation: "We was" appears in some English dialects (African American Vernacular English, working-class British). Exception: Dialect grammar has consistent rules; not "broken English" but different variety.

35. Identify the zeugma: "She broke his car and his heart"
A. "Broke" applies literally and figuratively
B. Parallel structure
C. Metaphor only
D. No rhetorical device
Answer: A
Explanation: Zeugma uses one word in two senses simultaneously ("broke" = damaged + devastated). Exception: Syllepsis is similar but uses word grammatically different ways; terms often overlap.
