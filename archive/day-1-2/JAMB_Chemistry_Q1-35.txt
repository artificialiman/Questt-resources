JAMB CHEMISTRY - EXCEPTIONAL QUESTIONS (1-35)

1. An element X has atomic number 17 and mass number 35. The number of neutrons is:
A. 17
B. 18
C. 35
D. 52
Answer: B
Explanation: Neutrons = mass number - atomic number = 35 - 17 = 18. Exception: Isotopes of same element have different neutron counts but same atomic number (proton count defines element).

2. Which electronic configuration violates Hund's rule?
A. 1s² 2s² 2p⁶
B. 1s² 2s² 2p⁴ (↑↓ ↑ ↑)
C. 1s² 2s² 2p⁴ (↑↓ ↑↓ ↑)
D. 1s² 2s² 2p³ (↑ ↑ ↑)
Answer: C
Explanation: Hund's rule: electrons singly occupy orbitals before pairing. Option C pairs prematurely. Exception: Maximum multiplicity (unpaired electrons) gives lowest energy—pairing increases electron-electron repulsion.

3. The ion with electronic configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ could be:
A. Na⁺ only
B. F⁻ only
C. Both Na⁺ and F⁻
D. Neither
Answer: C
Explanation: Both have 10 electrons (isoelectronic with Ne). Na loses 1e⁻, F gains 1e⁻. Exception: Isoelectronic species have same electron count but different nuclear charges—different sizes and properties.

4. Electronegativity increases across a period because:
A. Nuclear charge increases, atomic radius decreases
B. Shielding increases
C. Atomic radius increases
D. Ionization energy decreases
Answer: A
Explanation: More protons pull electrons stronger; smaller size means closer to nucleus. Exception: Noble gases often excluded from electronegativity trends (don't form bonds readily).

5. The first ionization energy of magnesium is lower than sodium because:
A. This statement is FALSE (Na < Mg)
B. Mg has more shielding
C. Mg has larger radius
D. Mg is a metal
Answer: A
Explanation: IE generally increases across period. Mg > Na. Question is trick/exception test. Exception: Actual exceptions in trend: Al < Mg (subshell), O < N (pairing energy).

6. Noble gases are unreactive because:
A. Full valence shell (stable octet)
B. High electronegativity
C. Large atomic radius
D. Low ionization energy
Answer: A
Explanation: ns²np⁶ configuration is stable. Exception: Xe and Kr CAN form compounds (XeF₄, KrF₂) with highly electronegative F—"inert" is misnomer for heavier noble gases.

7. The bond angle in water (104.5°) is less than methane (109.5°) because:
A. Lone pairs repel more than bonding pairs
B. Oxygen is more electronegative
C. Hydrogen bonding
D. Water is polar
Answer: A
Explanation: VSEPR: lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bond > bond-bond repulsion. 2 lone pairs compress bond angle. Exception: NH₃ (107°) also compressed from tetrahedral but less than H₂O (more lone pairs = more compression).

8. Which molecule is nonpolar despite having polar bonds?
A. CO₂ (linear, symmetrical)
B. H₂O
C. NH₃
D. HCl
Answer: A
Explanation: CO₂: two C=O bonds cancel (linear geometry). Exception: Molecular shape determines polarity; CCl₄ also nonpolar (tetrahedral symmetry) despite polar C-Cl bonds.

9. The hybridization of carbon in CO₂ is:
A. sp
B. sp²
C. sp³
D. sp³d
Answer: A
Explanation: Linear geometry = sp hybridization (2 regions of electron density). Exception: Same carbon can have different hybridizations: CH₄ (sp³), C₂H₄ (sp²), C₂H₂ (sp).

10. Resonance structures of benzene show:
A. Electrons are delocalized (not fixed double bonds)
B. Molecule oscillates between structures
C. Double bonds alternate rapidly
D. Two different compounds exist
Answer: A
Explanation: Resonance = single structure with delocalized electrons, NOT equilibrium between forms. Exception: Common misconception is that molecule "flips" between structures; actual structure is hybrid.

11. Hydrogen bonding is strongest between:
A. F-H···F (most electronegative)
B. O-H···O
C. N-H···N
D. C-H···O
Answer: A
Explanation: Strength: F-H > O-H > N-H (electronegativity trend). Exception: O-H bonds in water are more common/biologically important despite F-H being stronger.

12. The pH of 0.01 M HCl is:
A. 2
B. 1
C. 0.01
D. 12
Answer: A
Explanation: pH = -log[H⁺] = -log(10⁻²) = 2. Exception: Very concentrated acids (>1M) can have negative pH; very dilute bases can exceed pH 14.

13. A buffer solution resists pH change because:
A. Contains weak acid and its conjugate base
B. Contains strong acid
C. Is neutral
D. Has high concentration
Answer: A
Explanation: Buffer: HA/A⁻ pair. Absorbs added H⁺ or OH⁻. Exception: Buffers only effective within ±1 pH unit of pKa; outside this range, buffering capacity fails.

14. The pH at equivalence point in strong acid-strong base titration is:
A. 7
B. <7
C. >7
D. Depends on concentrations
Answer: A
Explanation: Neutral salt formed (NaCl from HCl + NaOH). Exception: Weak acid-strong base gives pH >7; strong acid-weak base gives pH <7 at equivalence point.

15. Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C. At higher temperature, Kw:
A. Increases (ionization is endothermic)
B. Decreases
C. Stays constant
D. Becomes zero
Answer: A
Explanation: Water ionization is endothermic; Le Chatelier predicts increase with temperature. Exception: Neutral pH at 60°C is ~6.5 (not 7) because Kw increases.

16. The oxidation number of Cr in K₂Cr₂O₇ is:
A. +6
B. +7
C. +12
D. +14
Answer: A
Explanation: 2(+1) + 2x + 7(-2) = 0, so x = +6. Exception: Maximum oxidation state usually equals group number; Cr in Group 6 can reach +6.

17. In the reaction 2Fe²⁺ → 2Fe³⁺ + 2e⁻, iron is:
A. Oxidized (loses electrons)
B. Reduced
C. Oxidizing agent
D. Unchanged
Answer: A
Explanation: Oxidation = loss of electrons (OIL RIG). Fe²⁺ is reducing agent. Exception: "Oxidized" doesn't require oxygen; originally meant combining with oxygen, now means electron loss.

18. The standard hydrogen electrode is assigned:
A. E° = 0.00 V (reference point)
B. E° = 1.00 V
C. E° = -1.00 V
D. E° = +0.76 V
Answer: A
Explanation: SHE is reference; all other potentials measured relative to it. Exception: Arbitrary choice; could have chosen any value, but 0 V is convenient.

19. In galvanic cell, the anode is:
A. Negative electrode (oxidation occurs)
B. Positive electrode
C. Where reduction occurs
D. Made of copper
Answer: A
Explanation: Anode = oxidation = negative in galvanic cell. Exception: In electrolytic cell, anode is POSITIVE (but still oxidation site)—confusion point.

20. Faraday's law: mass deposited is proportional to:
A. Charge passed (Q = nF)
B. Current only
C. Voltage
D. Resistance
Answer: A
Explanation: m ∝ Q. Specifically: m = (Q × M)/(n × F). Exception: Time matters through Q = It; doubling current OR doubling time doubles mass.

21. Haber process produces ammonia at:
A. High pressure, moderate temperature, Fe catalyst
B. Low pressure, high temperature
C. Room conditions
D. High temperature only
Answer: A
Explanation: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃ (exothermic, Δn < 0). Le Chatelier: high P favors products, low T favors products but slows reaction—compromise at 450°C. Exception: Equilibrium position vs rate conflict requires optimization.

22. In N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃, adding more N₂:
A. Shifts equilibrium right (more NH₃)
B. Shifts left
C. No effect on equilibrium
D. Stops reaction
Answer: A
Explanation: Le Chatelier: system counteracts change by consuming added N₂. Exception: Kp unchanged; only position shifts, not equilibrium constant.

23. The equilibrium constant Kc for 2A ⇌ B is 4. For B ⇌ 2A, Kc is:
A. 0.25 (1/4)
B. 4
C. 16
D. 2
Answer: A
Explanation: Reversing reaction inverts K: K_reverse = 1/K_forward. Exception: Multiplying equation by n raises K to power n; reversing takes reciprocal.

24. A reaction is spontaneous if:
A. ΔG < 0
B. ΔH < 0
C. ΔS > 0
D. All of the above
Answer: A
Explanation: Gibbs: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Spontaneous when ΔG < 0. Exception: Endothermic reactions (ΔH > 0) CAN be spontaneous if ΔS is large and positive (entropy-driven).

25. Diamond is harder than graphite because:
A. 3D network of strong C-C bonds vs 2D layers
B. Diamond has metallic bonding
C. Graphite has ionic bonding
D. Diamond has more electrons
Answer: A
Explanation: Diamond: sp³, tetrahedral. Graphite: sp², layered with weak van der Waals between layers. Exception: Graphite conducts electricity (delocalized electrons in layers); diamond doesn't.

26. The melting point of NaCl (ionic) is higher than I₂ (molecular) because:
A. Ionic bonds stronger than van der Waals forces
B. NaCl has more atoms
C. I₂ is covalent
D. NaCl is soluble in water
Answer: A
Explanation: Ionic > covalent network > metallic > polar molecular > nonpolar molecular (general trend). Exception: Network covalent (diamond, SiO₂) can exceed some ionic compounds.

27. Transition metals show variable oxidation states because:
A. d electrons participate in bonding
B. They are large atoms
C. They are metals
D. They conduct electricity
Answer: A
Explanation: d electrons have similar energy to s electrons; can lose different numbers. Exception: Scandium and zinc (on edges of d-block) show mainly +3 and +2 respectively—less variable.

28. Which is a Lewis acid?
A. BF₃ (electron deficient)
B. NH₃
C. H₂O
D. OH⁻
Answer: A
Explanation: Lewis acid = electron pair acceptor. BF₃ has empty orbital. Exception: Broader than Brønsted (proton transfer); includes species without H⁺.

29. The pH of 10⁻⁸ M HCl is:
A. Approximately 7 (water ionization dominates)
B. Exactly 8
C. Exactly -8
D. 14
Answer: A
Explanation: At very low acid concentration, water's H⁺ (10⁻⁷ M) becomes significant. Total [H⁺] ≈ 10⁻⁷ M, pH ≈ 7. Exception: Can't ignore water ionization when acid concentration < 10⁻⁶ M.

30. Effusion rate of gas A is twice that of gas B. If M_A = 4, then M_B is:
A. 16
B. 8
C. 2
D. 1
Answer: A
Explanation: Graham's law: rate ∝ 1/√M. r_A/r_B = √(M_B/M_A). 2 = √(M_B/4), so M_B = 16. Exception: Rates inversely proportional to square root of molar mass, not mass directly.

31. Real gases deviate from ideal behavior at:
A. High pressure and low temperature
B. Low pressure and high temperature
C. All conditions equally
D. Never deviate
Answer: A
Explanation: High P: volume of molecules matters. Low T: intermolecular forces matter. Exception: Ideal gas law assumes point particles with no attractions—fails when these assumptions break down.

32. The van der Waals equation corrects ideal gas law for:
A. Molecular volume (b) and intermolecular forces (a)
B. Temperature only
C. Pressure only
D. Chemical reactions
Answer: A
Explanation: (P + a/V²)(V - b) = RT. 'a' corrects pressure, 'b' corrects volume. Exception: Different gases have different a and b values; no single correction works for all.

33. Charcoal adsorbs gases because:
A. High surface area (porous structure)
B. It's black
C. It's solid
D. It's carbon
Answer: A
Explanation: Adsorption (surface) vs absorption (volume). Activated charcoal has huge surface area. Exception: Physical adsorption (weak van der Waals) is reversible; chemisorption involves bond formation.

34. A catalyst increases reaction rate by:
A. Lowering activation energy
B. Increasing temperature
C. Increasing concentration
D. Shifting equilibrium
Answer: A
Explanation: Catalyst provides alternative pathway with lower Ea. Exception: Catalyst doesn't change ΔH, ΔG, or equilibrium position—only affects rate of reaching equilibrium.

35. Rate = k[A]²[B]. If [A] doubles and [B] triples, rate:
A. Increases 12× (2² × 3)
B. Increases 6×
C. Doubles
D. Triples
Answer: A
Explanation: Rate_new = k(2[A])²(3[B]) = 4 × 3 × k[A]²[B] = 12 × Rate_old. Exception: Reaction order determines how concentration changes affect rate—not always linear.
