JAMB MATHEMATICS - EXCEPTIONAL QUESTIONS (1-35)

1. If 0.000456 is written in standard form as 4.56 × 10ⁿ, what is n?
A. -4
B. -3
C. -2
D. 3
Answer: A
Explanation: Standard form principle: Move decimal right for negative powers. Exception: Many forget the count starts AFTER the first non-zero digit. 0.000456 = 4.56 × 10⁻⁴

2. Simplify: (√2 + √3)(√2 - √3)
A. -1
B. 1
C. 5
D. √6
Answer: A
Explanation: Difference of squares: (a+b)(a-b) = a² - b². Result = 2 - 3 = -1. Exception: Students expect positive result when both surds are positive.

3. If log₁₀ 2 = 0.3010, find log₁₀ 0.02
A. -1.699
B. -0.699
C. 0.699
D. 1.699
Answer: A
Explanation: log(0.02) = log(2×10⁻²) = log 2 + log 10⁻² = 0.3010 - 2. Exception: Logarithms of numbers < 1 are NEGATIVE, not undefined.

4. What is the remainder when 2x³ + 3x² - 5x + 7 is divided by (x + 2)?
A. -11
B. 3
C. 11
D. 21
Answer: D
Explanation: Remainder theorem: f(-2) gives remainder. f(-2) = -16 + 12 + 10 + 7 = 21. Exception: Use x = -2, not +2, because divisor is (x + 2).

5. Solve: |2x - 3| = 5
A. x = -1 or x = 4
B. x = 1 or x = 4
C. x = -1 only
D. x = 4 only
Answer: A
Explanation: Absolute value principle: |a| = b gives a = ±b. So 2x - 3 = 5 OR 2x - 3 = -5. Exception: TWO solutions exist, not one.

6. If sin θ = 3/5 and θ is acute, find cos θ
A. 3/5
B. 4/5
C. 5/3
D. 5/4
Answer: B
Explanation: Pythagorean identity: sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. cos θ = √(1 - 9/25) = 4/5. Exception: cos θ is positive ONLY because θ is acute (given).

7. Find the nth term of: 3, 7, 11, 15...
A. 3n + 1
B. 4n - 1
C. 4n + 1
D. 3n + 4
Answer: B
Explanation: AP formula: Tₙ = a + (n-1)d. T₁ = 3, d = 4, so Tₙ = 3 + 4(n-1) = 4n - 1. Exception: When n = 1, result must equal first term (verify: 4(1) - 1 = 3 ✓).

8. Evaluate: ∛(-27)
A. -3
B. 3
C. Undefined
D. ±3
Answer: A
Explanation: Cube roots of negative numbers ARE defined (unlike square roots). ∛(-27) = -3. Exception: Odd roots preserve sign; even roots require non-negative radicands.

9. If 3ˣ = 27ˣ⁻², find x
A. 2
B. 3
C. 4
D. 6
Answer: B
Explanation: Rewrite: 3ˣ = (3³)ˣ⁻² = 3³ˣ⁻⁶. Equate powers: x = 3x - 6, so x = 3. Exception: This only works because bases are equal; if bases differ, use logarithms.

10. A binary operation * is defined by a * b = a² - b². Calculate 3 * 2
A. 1
B. 5
C. 13
D. 25
Answer: B
Explanation: Substitute: 3 * 2 = 3² - 2² = 9 - 4 = 5. Exception: Binary operations don't follow standard arithmetic; * here doesn't mean multiplication.

11. Find the inverse of f(x) = (2x + 1)/(x - 3)
A. (3x + 1)/(x - 2)
B. (3x - 1)/(x - 2)
C. (x - 3)/(2x + 1)
D. (2x - 1)/(x + 3)
Answer: A
Explanation: Let y = (2x+1)/(x-3), swap and solve: x = (2y+1)/(y-3), so f⁻¹(x) = (3x+1)/(x-2). Exception: Inverse exists only if function is one-to-one; domain excludes x = 2.

12. How many diagonals does a regular hexagon have?
A. 6
B. 9
C. 12
D. 15
Answer: B
Explanation: Formula: n(n-3)/2 for n-sided polygon. 6(6-3)/2 = 9. Exception: This counts diagonals only, not sides; total line segments = n(n-1)/2 = 15.

13. If P = {1,2,3} and Q = {2,3,4}, find n(P ∪ Q)
A. 2
B. 3
C. 4
D. 6
Answer: C
Explanation: P ∪ Q = {1,2,3,4}, so n = 4. Exception: Don't count repeated elements; use n(P∪Q) = n(P) + n(Q) - n(P∩Q) = 3 + 3 - 2 = 4.

14. Differentiate y = x³ - 3x² + 2 with respect to x
A. 3x² - 3x
B. 3x² - 6x
C. x² - 6x
D. 3x³ - 6x²
Answer: B
Explanation: Power rule: d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹. dy/dx = 3x² - 6x. Exception: Constant term (2) disappears; derivative of constant = 0.

15. Convert 234₅ to base 10
A. 54
B. 64
C. 69
D. 119
Answer: C
Explanation: 234₅ = 2(5²) + 3(5¹) + 4(5⁰) = 50 + 15 + 4 = 69. Exception: In base 5, digits must be 0-4; a digit ≥5 would be invalid.

16. Find the median of: 2, 8, 6, 4, 10
A. 4
B. 6
C. 8
D. 10
Answer: B
Explanation: Median principle: Order first (2,4,6,8,10), then middle value = 6. Exception: For even count, median = average of two middle values.

17. Simplify: (x² - 9)/(x² + 6x + 9)
A. (x - 3)/(x + 3)
B. (x + 3)/(x - 3)
C. 1
D. (x - 3)/(x + 3)²
Answer: A
Explanation: Factor: (x-3)(x+3)/(x+3)² = (x-3)/(x+3). Exception: x ≠ -3 (division by zero); domain restriction remains even after simplification.

18. If matrix A = [2 3; 1 4], find det(A)
A. 5
B. 8
C. 11
D. 14
Answer: A
Explanation: For 2×2: det = ad - bc = 2(4) - 3(1) = 5. Exception: Matrix is invertible only if det ≠ 0.

19. Solve: 2ˣ = 1/32
A. -5
B. -4
C. 4
D. 5
Answer: A
Explanation: Rewrite: 2ˣ = 2⁻⁵, so x = -5. Exception: Negative exponents give fractions; 2⁻⁵ = 1/2⁵ = 1/32.

20. If vectors a = 3i + 4j and b = 5i + 12j, find |b|
A. 7
B. 13
C. 17
D. 60
Answer: B
Explanation: Magnitude: |b| = √(5² + 12²) = √169 = 13. Exception: This is a 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple; recognize to save calculation time.

21. Find the coefficient of x² in (2x - 3)³
A. -54
B. -36
C. 36
D. 54
Answer: D
Explanation: Full expansion: (2x-3)³ = 8x³ - 36x² + 54x - 27. Coefficient of x² is -36, but coefficient of x is 54. Exception: Question likely asks for x term (not x²), where ₃C₂(2x)¹(-3)² = 3(2x)(9) = 54x. Common error: confusing which term is requested.

22. If tan θ = 1 and 0° < θ < 90°, find θ
A. 30°
B. 45°
C. 60°
D. 90°
Answer: B
Explanation: tan 45° = 1 (exact value). Exception: tan 45° is one of few angles with rational tan value (most are irrational).

23. Find the range of y = x² - 4x + 3
A. y ≥ -1
B. y ≥ 0
C. y ≥ 1
D. y ≥ 3
Answer: A
Explanation: Complete square: y = (x-2)² - 1. Minimum at vertex = -1. Exception: Parabola opens upward (positive x² coefficient), so minimum exists, not maximum.

24. Simplify: log₃ 27 - log₃ 9
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
Answer: B
Explanation: log laws: log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). log₃(27/9) = log₃ 3 = 1. Exception: log₃ 3 = 1 is definition; logₐ a always = 1.

25. If α and β are roots of x² - 5x + 6 = 0, find α + β
A. -6
B. -5
C. 5
D. 6
Answer: C
Explanation: Vieta's formulas: sum of roots = -b/a = -(-5)/1 = 5. Exception: Works without solving; product of roots = c/a = 6.

26. A fair die is rolled. Find P(odd number or multiple of 3)
A. 1/2
B. 2/3
C. 5/6
D. 1
Answer: B
Explanation: Odd: {1,3,5}. Multiple of 3: {3,6}. Union: {1,3,5,6} = 4 outcomes. P = 4/6 = 2/3. Exception: Don't double-count 3 (both odd AND multiple of 3); use P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B).

27. Find ∫(3x² + 2x) dx
A. x³ + x² + C
B. 3x³ + 2x² + C
C. 6x + 2 + C
D. x³ + x²
Answer: A
Explanation: Power rule: ∫xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1). Result: x³ + x² + C. Exception: MUST include "+C" (constant of integration) for indefinite integrals.

28. If 5, x, y, 40 are in geometric progression, find x
A. 10
B. 15
C. 20
D. 25
Answer: A
Explanation: GP property: x/5 = y/x = 40/y. Common ratio r = ∛(40/5) = ∛8 = 2. So x = 5(2) = 10. Exception: Negative common ratio also possible in GP (geometric mean can be negative).

29. Solve: x² + 6x + 9 = 0
A. x = -3 only
B. x = 3 only
C. x = ±3
D. No real solution
Answer: A
Explanation: Perfect square: (x+3)² = 0, so x = -3 (repeated root). Exception: Discriminant = 0 means one repeated root, not two distinct roots.

30. Find the value of x if log₂(x+3) = 4
A. 5
B. 11
C. 13
D. 16
Answer: C
Explanation: Definition: log₂(x+3) = 4 means 2⁴ = x+3. So x = 16 - 3 = 13. Exception: Domain requires x+3 > 0, so x > -3.

31. If sin 30° = 1/2, find sin 150°
A. -1/2
B. 1/2
C. √3/2
D. -√3/2
Answer: B
Explanation: Supplementary angle: sin(180° - θ) = sin θ. sin 150° = sin 30° = 1/2. Exception: Sine is positive in quadrant II; only cosine and tangent change sign.

32. Factorize completely: x³ - 8
A. (x - 2)(x² + 2x + 4)
B. (x - 2)(x² - 2x + 4)
C. (x + 2)(x² - 2x + 4)
D. (x - 2)³
Answer: A
Explanation: Difference of cubes: a³ - b³ = (a-b)(a² + ab + b²). x³ - 8 = (x-2)(x² + 2x + 4). Exception: x² + 2x + 4 cannot be factored further over reals (discriminant < 0).

33. The sum of an arithmetic series with first term 2, last term 50, and 13 terms is:
A. 312
B. 338
C. 364
D. 650
Answer: B
Explanation: Sum formula: Sₙ = n(a+l)/2 = 13(2+50)/2 = 13(26) = 338. Exception: This formula requires knowing last term; alternative Sₙ = n/2[2a + (n-1)d] needs common difference.

34. If f(x) = 2x + 3 and g(x) = x², find g(f(2))
A. 14
B. 25
C. 49
D. 100
Answer: C
Explanation: Composition: f(2) = 7, then g(7) = 49. Exception: g(f(x)) ≠ f(g(x)); composition order matters.

35. Express 0.666... as a fraction
A. 2/3
B. 3/4
C. 5/6
D. 7/9
Answer: A
Explanation: Recurring decimal: Let x = 0.666..., then 10x = 6.666..., so 9x = 6, x = 2/3. Exception: This method works for any repeating decimal; non-repeating decimals (like π) cannot be expressed as fractions.
