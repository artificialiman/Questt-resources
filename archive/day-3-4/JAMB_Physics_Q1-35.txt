JAMB PHYSICS - EXCEPTIONAL QUESTIONS (1-35)

1. A body moving with constant velocity has:
A. Zero acceleration
B. Constant acceleration
C. Increasing acceleration
D. Decreasing acceleration
Answer: A
Explanation: Constant velocity means no change in speed or direction, so a = Δv/Δt = 0. Exception: Many confuse velocity with speed; constant speed with changing direction (circular motion) HAS acceleration.

2. An object is thrown vertically upward. At its highest point:
A. Velocity = 0, acceleration = 0
B. Velocity = 0, acceleration = g (downward)
C. Velocity = g, acceleration = 0
D. Both velocity and acceleration are maximum
Answer: B
Explanation: At peak, v = 0 instantaneously, but gravity still acts (a = 9.8 m/s² downward). Exception: Acceleration is NOT zero at highest point—common misconception; gravity never stops acting.

3. A 5 kg block on a frictionless surface is pushed with 20 N force. If friction force is 5 N, find acceleration:
A. 3 m/s²
B. 4 m/s²
C. 5 m/s²
D. Cannot be determined
Answer: A
Explanation: Wait—question says "frictionless" but then mentions friction. This is inconsistent. If friction = 5 N: Net force = 20 - 5 = 15 N, a = F/m = 15/5 = 3 m/s². Exception: Contradictory problem; demonstrates importance of reading carefully for errors.

4. Two forces of 6 N and 8 N act perpendicular to each other. The resultant force is:
A. 2 N
B. 10 N
C. 14 N
D. 48 N
Answer: B
Explanation: Perpendicular forces: R = √(F₁² + F₂²) = √(36 + 64) = 10 N. Exception: This is a 3-4-5 Pythagorean triple scaled by 2; many simply add forces linearly (14 N) ignoring vector nature.

5. A car travels 100 m in 5 s at constant acceleration from rest. Find acceleration:
A. 4 m/s²
B. 8 m/s²
C. 10 m/s²
D. 20 m/s²
Answer: B
Explanation: s = ut + ½at². With u = 0: 100 = ½a(25), so a = 8 m/s². Exception: Cannot use v = u + at without knowing final velocity; must use displacement equation.

6. Newton's third law states action-reaction pairs:
A. Act on the same object
B. Act on different objects
C. Cancel each other out
D. Only apply to collisions
Answer: B
Explanation: Action-reaction forces act on DIFFERENT objects (book on table / table on book). Exception: Common error is thinking they cancel—they can't cancel because they act on different bodies.

7. An object weighs 60 N on Earth. On the Moon (g = 1.6 m/s²), it weighs:
A. 10 N
B. 36 N
C. 60 N
D. 360 N
Answer: A
Explanation: Mass = W/g = 60/10 = 6 kg (constant). Moon weight = mg = 6(1.6) = 9.6 ≈ 10 N. Exception: Mass is invariant; weight changes with gravity—common confusion between mass and weight.

8. A projectile is launched at 45° for maximum range. At 30°, the range is:
A. Greater than at 45°
B. Less than at 45°
C. Equal to at 45°
D. Zero
Answer: B
Explanation: Maximum range occurs at 45° (for given velocity). Any other angle gives less range. Exception: Complementary angles (30° and 60°) give EQUAL ranges, but both less than 45°.

9. A ball dropped from height h takes time t to hit ground. From height 4h, time taken is:
A. t
B. 2t
C. 4t
D. 16t
Answer: B
Explanation: h ∝ t² (from h = ½gt²). If h increases 4×, t increases √4 = 2×. Exception: Linear thinking (4h → 4t) is wrong; relationship is quadratic.

10. Momentum is conserved in:
A. Elastic collisions only
B. Inelastic collisions only
C. All collisions (isolated system)
D. No collisions
Answer: C
Explanation: Momentum conserved in ALL collisions if no external force. Exception: Kinetic energy is conserved ONLY in elastic collisions; don't confuse momentum conservation with energy conservation.

11. A 2 kg object moving at 5 m/s collides with 3 kg object at rest. They stick together. Final velocity:
A. 1 m/s
B. 2 m/s
C. 3 m/s
D. 5 m/s
Answer: B
Explanation: Momentum conservation: 2(5) + 3(0) = (2+3)v, so v = 10/5 = 2 m/s. Exception: This is perfectly inelastic collision (objects stick); KE is NOT conserved, only momentum.

12. Power is defined as:
A. Work done per unit time
B. Force times distance
C. Energy stored
D. Force times velocity
Answer: A (also D is valid)
Explanation: P = W/t (primary definition). Also P = Fv (instantaneous power). Exception: Both A and D are correct; question should specify or accept both.

13. A machine lifts 500 N load through 2 m using 200 N effort over 6 m. Efficiency is:
A. 40%
B. 60%
C. 83.3%
D. 120%
Answer: C
Explanation: Efficiency = (Work output / Work input) × 100 = (500×2)/(200×6) × 100 = 83.3%. Exception: Efficiency can NEVER exceed 100% (would violate energy conservation); option D is impossible.

14. The unit of impulse is:
A. N
B. N·s (same as kg·m/s)
C. J
D. W
Answer: B
Explanation: Impulse = FΔt (units: N·s). Also = Δ(mv) (units: kg·m/s). Exception: N·s and kg·m/s are equivalent but look different; impulse = change in momentum.

15. A spring with constant k = 100 N/m is compressed 0.2 m. Elastic PE stored:
A. 2 J
B. 4 J
C. 10 J
D. 20 J
Answer: A
Explanation: PE = ½kx² = ½(100)(0.04) = 2 J. Exception: Common error is forgetting the ½ factor or not squaring displacement.

16. Two resistors (4Ω and 6Ω) in parallel have equivalent resistance:
A. 2.4Ω
B. 5Ω
C. 10Ω
D. 24Ω
Answer: A
Explanation: 1/R = 1/4 + 1/6 = 5/12, so R = 12/5 = 2.4Ω. Exception: Parallel resistance is LESS than smallest individual resistor (not average, not sum).

17. A wire of resistance R is stretched to double its length. New resistance:
A. R/2
B. R
C. 2R
D. 4R
Answer: D
Explanation: R = ρL/A. If L doubles, volume constant means A halves. R_new = ρ(2L)/(A/2) = 4R. Exception: Resistance increases by square of length ratio; volume conservation crucial.

18. In a circuit, ammeter should be connected in:
A. Series (to measure current through)
B. Parallel (to measure voltage)
C. Either series or parallel
D. Depends on value
Answer: A
Explanation: Ammeter measures current, must be in series (low resistance). Voltmeter in parallel (high resistance). Exception: Ideal ammeter has zero resistance; real ammeters have small resistance affecting circuit.

19. Kirchhoff's current law states:
A. Sum of currents entering junction = sum leaving
B. Voltage drop around loop = 0
C. Resistance is constant
D. Power is conserved
Answer: A
Explanation: KCL: ΣI_in = ΣI_out (charge conservation at junction). Exception: This is statement of charge conservation; Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) deals with energy around loops.

20. A transformer with 100 turns (primary) and 500 turns (secondary) has:
A. Step-down (voltage decreases)
B. Step-up (voltage increases 5×)
C. 1:1 ratio
D. Current increases 5×
Answer: B
Explanation: V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p = 500/100 = 5. Voltage increases. Exception: Current does opposite: I_s/I_p = N_p/N_s = 1/5 (current decreases); power conserved.

21. AC current has RMS value of 10 A. Peak current is:
A. 7.07 A
B. 10 A
C. 14.14 A
D. 20 A
Answer: C
Explanation: I_peak = I_rms × √2 = 10√2 ≈ 14.14 A. Exception: RMS (root mean square) is the effective value; peak is √2 times larger, NOT 2 times.

22. The speed of light in glass (n = 1.5) is:
A. 3 × 10⁸ m/s
B. 2 × 10⁸ m/s
C. 1.5 × 10⁸ m/s
D. 4.5 × 10⁸ m/s
Answer: B
Explanation: n = c/v, so v = c/n = (3×10⁸)/1.5 = 2×10⁸ m/s. Exception: Light slows in denser medium; can never exceed c (vacuum speed).

23. Total internal reflection occurs when light travels:
A. From denser to rarer medium at angle > critical
B. From rarer to denser medium
C. At any angle
D. Only in fiber optics
Answer: A
Explanation: TIR requires: denser → rarer AND angle > critical angle. Exception: Cannot occur going rarer → denser (light always refracts into denser medium).

24. A concave mirror has focal length 20 cm. An object at 30 cm produces image at:
A. 60 cm (real, inverted)
B. 12 cm (virtual, upright)
C. 60 cm (virtual, upright)
D. Infinity
Answer: A
Explanation: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. 1/20 = 1/30 + 1/v, so v = 60 cm. Positive v = real image (inverted). Exception: Between F and C, image is beyond C, magnified and inverted.

25. Two waves with same frequency interfere. If path difference = λ/2:
A. Constructive interference (bright)
B. Destructive interference (dark)
C. No interference
D. Partial interference
Answer: B
Explanation: Path difference = (n + ½)λ gives destructive interference (180° phase difference). Exception: Path difference = nλ gives constructive; half-wavelength shift inverts wave.

26. The frequency of a wave with wavelength 2 m traveling at 10 m/s is:
A. 0.2 Hz
B. 5 Hz
C. 20 Hz
D. 50 Hz
Answer: B
Explanation: v = fλ, so f = v/λ = 10/2 = 5 Hz. Exception: Don't confuse frequency (oscillations/time) with wave speed (distance/time).

27. Doppler effect causes observed frequency to:
A. Increase when source approaches
B. Decrease when source approaches
C. Remain constant
D. Double when source approaches
Answer: A
Explanation: Approaching source: waves compressed, wavelength decreases, frequency increases. Exception: Applies to sound AND light; light shows redshift (receding) / blueshift (approaching).

28. In a standing wave, distance between consecutive nodes is:
A. λ/4
B. λ/2
C. λ
D. 2λ
Answer: B
Explanation: Node to node = half wavelength. Antinode to antinode = half wavelength. Node to antinode = quarter wavelength. Exception: Don't confuse node spacing with antinode spacing.

29. At absolute zero (0 K), molecular motion:
A. Stops completely (classically)
B. Continues (quantum zero-point energy)
C. Increases
D. Becomes chaotic
Answer: B
Explanation: Classically, motion stops. Quantum mechanically, zero-point energy means some motion remains. Exception: Heisenberg uncertainty principle forbids truly zero motion.

30. Internal energy of ideal gas depends on:
A. Temperature only
B. Pressure and volume
C. Volume only
D. All of the above
Answer: A
Explanation: For ideal gas, U depends only on T (kinetic energy of molecules). Exception: Real gases have intermolecular forces; U depends on volume too.

31. First law of thermodynamics states:
A. ΔU = Q - W
B. Entropy always increases
C. Heat flows hot to cold
D. Energy is constant
Answer: A
Explanation: ΔU = Q - W (energy conservation). Q = heat added, W = work done BY system. Exception: Sign convention varies; some texts use ΔU = Q + W (work done ON system).

32. In adiabatic process:
A. Q = 0 (no heat transfer)
B. ΔU = 0
C. W = 0
D. P = constant
Answer: A
Explanation: Adiabatic: thermally isolated, Q = 0. From first law: ΔU = -W. Exception: Temperature CHANGES in adiabatic process (unlike isothermal where T constant).

33. Heat capacity of water is 4200 J/(kg·K). Energy needed to raise 2 kg by 5°C:
A. 2100 J
B. 8400 J
C. 21000 J
D. 42000 J
Answer: D
Explanation: Q = mcΔT = 2 × 4200 × 5 = 42000 J. Exception: Specific heat capacity is per kg per degree; don't forget mass AND temperature change.

34. A photoelectric experiment shows electrons emitted when light frequency exceeds threshold. This supports:
A. Wave theory (classical)
B. Particle theory (quantum)
C. Both equally
D. Neither
Answer: B
Explanation: Photoelectric effect proves photons (particles). Below threshold, no emission regardless of intensity. Exception: Classical wave theory predicts intensity matters, not frequency—experiment disproved this.

35. De Broglie wavelength of a particle with momentum p is:
A. λ = h/p
B. λ = p/h
C. λ = hp
D. λ = h/p²
Answer: A
Explanation: λ = h/p where h is Planck's constant. Exception: Wave-particle duality; all matter has wavelength, but only significant for small masses (electrons), negligible for macroscopic objects.
